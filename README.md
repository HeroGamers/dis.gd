# Dis.gd - The Discord Shortened Link Cheatsheet

---

The dis.gd cheatsheet is a list, which was initially made for helping with remembering the dis.gd links, and should be a help to future Moderators to quickly look up and remember the most useful of the links.
This way, people can help users without having to look up support articles and other relevant posts through Google.

## Website
You can view the dis.gd cheatsheet on [herogamers.dev/dis.gd](https://herogamers.dev/dis.gd/) !

## Contributing
We'd love to receive your PR's on the repository with new links as they become available!
But first, we'd like to ask you to please follow the following guidelines:
1. Do not add any dis.gd links which aren't meant to be shared publicly (like specific forms and surveys).
2. Don't just write the URL that shows up in your browser when you use a shortened link - instead use a [Redirect Checker](https://www.redirect-checker.org), and copy the first redirect that's found, not the final destination.
