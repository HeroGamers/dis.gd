# Dis.gd - The Discord Shortened Link Cheatsheet

---

The dis.gd cheatsheet is a list, which was initially made for helping with remembering the dis.gd links, and should be a help to future Moderators to quickly look up and remember the most useful of the links.
This way, people can help users without having to look up support articles and other relevant posts through Google.

## Website
You can view the dis.gd cheatsheet on [herogamers.dev/dis.gd](https://herogamers.dev/dis.gd/) !

## Contributing
We'd love to receive your PR's on the repository with new links as they become available!
But first, we'd like to ask you to please follow the following guidelines:
1. Do not add any dis.gd links which aren't meant to be shared publicly (like specific forms and surveys).
2. Don't just write the URL that shows up in your browser when you use a shortened link - instead use a [Redirect Checker](https://www.redirect-checker.org), and copy the first redirect that's found, not the final destination.
3. Be sure to check the [Usefulness Guidelines](#Usefulness-Guidelines), and try to follow them to your best ability.

## Usefulness Guidelines
To ensure that all shortlinks have the same underlying basis for their usefulness, and to reduce the potential for biased usefulness ratings, we have decided on the following usefulness guidelines.
Please try and follow them as closely as possible - however, it is not always possible to fit a shortlink perfectly into a specific usefulness rating, so it's up to you to decide on what usefulness category the shortlink in question fits into.
The following are the usefulness guidelines, and we ask that you try and follow them:
1. Very essential shortlinks (not time-limited).
2. Useful shortlinks that are good to know to make it easier to help others (can be time-limited).
3. Not so useful shortlinks, that are not useful for everyone, but can be useful in some specific situations.
4. Rarely used shortlinks, or fun shortlinks (also usually blogposts).
5. Why does this even have a shortlink? (server invites, expired links, closed forms, 404's, old blogposts).

### Examples on deciding on a usefulness rating
Here are some examples on deciding usefulness ratings:
- dis.gd/report (Submit a request to T&S)
  - Usefulness 1 - it is very essential to know the following link, you can end up using it multiple times a day
- dis.gd/status (Discord Operating Status)
  - Usefulness 2 - this is probably a good link to know, but not like you are going to post it every day
- dis.gd/2fa (How to setup 2FA)
  - Usefulness 3 - you probably won't get into many situations where you would have to use the following shortlink
- dis.gd/modappreciation (Blogpost on the life of moderators)
  - Usefulness 4 - even though it's a good blogpost, you already know that this won't be used, not even monthly)
- dis.gd/mumbojumbo (An invite to Mumbo Jumbo's server)
  - Usefulness 5 - even though it's probably a very good server, I doubt that this would even be usefull in rare occasions
- dis.gd/jauz (Blogpost about a Partner Party from 2019)
  - Usefulness 5 - literally no one would use this link anymore, if it was a current thing, it would probably have been Usefulness 4
